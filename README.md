# Catblocks! (Petblocks)
Catblocks! is a multi-purpose smart cat feeding device intended to automate much of the hassle of feeding your cat. Its hallmark feature is its stacked-box look, combined with an auger-powered dispenser that pushes kibble into your cat's bowl.

The box freatures an ultrasonic sensor that tracks the height of the food left in the bin so that you always know when you need to buy refills. It also has a BME280 atmospheric sensor for temperature and humidity readinds, an air quality sensor for room air readindgs, two LED screens for viewing said information, a neopixel ring for aesthetics controllable via the internet, buttons for manual control of the auger and agitator screws, a hall sensor to make sure the bin is closed, a scale to weigh food dispensed, and connection to an Adafruit Dashboard where users can control aspects like food schedules (yet to be implemented -- stay tuned!).

Users can get started using the following list of supplies.
